In November of 2018, Lightning Network Chiang Mai (LNCM) participated in a hackathon organised by Rootstock. We claimed victory with the creation of a technical demo for a system called "Supercavitation Swaps".

Supercaviation Swaps uses the Lightning Network to allow BTC to be swapped for RSK's RBTC, quickly, cheaply, and in a trust-minimized way.  Swaps are settled in under a minute, have low fees, and are completed without having to trust a centralized exchange or federation.

Our approach allows any user with a Lighting Network wallet to easily onboard onto RSK, and even those who don't already own any RBTC can do so safely in a novel, trust-minimised way.

During the 24 hour hackathon, we deployed a working demo to the RSK testnet, using testnet Lightning BTC and a frontend on IPFS. 

We built upon the ideas of [Lightning to BTC Atomic Swaps ("Submarine Swaps")](https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/) by Alex Bosworth and [Lightning to ETH Atomic Swaps](https://blog.goodaudience.com/atomic-on-chain-eth-to-off-chain-btc-swap-3c959ab22e52) by Jason Wong.

For more a more detailed overview on the rationale and to view the code, please have a look at the [github repository](https://github.com/lncm/supercavitation-swaps).
