It is particularly suited to facilitate retail PoS transactions, micropayments, IoT with pay-per-use billing models, vending machines, ATMs and countless other exciting possibilities.</p>\n<p>Running a box enables individuals to take control of their digital money and gives businesses the ability to offer cashless payments at an incredibly low cost.</p>\n<p>LNCM's system is modular and allows customization of both hardware and software components, in order to be adapted to any particular scenario. For instance, the Bitcoin capabilities can be extended to offer lightning payments on Litecoin without disturbing functionality or the security model.</p>\n<p>Public APIs allow other software to communicate with the system and extend functionality according to individual or business requirements.</p>\n<p>We have partnerships with organizations that are eager to adopt the platform and help shape the development of this exciting new technology.
